# Castellers

A [castell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castell) is a human tower built traditionally in festivals at many locations within Catalonia, Spain.

In order to create a castell people must climb on each others shoulders.
The heavier and taller people go to the base, whereas the shorter and ligher go to the top of the castell.
Create a program that given a list of people (along with their height and weight), it will give as output the castell with the maximum possible
number of people.
Remember that in order for one person to climb on top of another is must be lighter and shorter.

For example given the following people:
```
Person  Height  Weight
P1      6'0"    190lbs
P2      5'5"    200lbs
P3      5'7"    140lbs
P4      6'3"    150lbs
P5      5'9"    180lbs
```
The longest castell would be P1, P5, P3
